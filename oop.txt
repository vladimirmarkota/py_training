OOP
Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable and scalable applications.

OOP is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior. In OOP, object has attributes thing that has specific data and can perform certain actions using methods.

Key Features of OOP in Python:
Organizes code into classes and objects
Supports encapsulation to group data and methods together
Enables inheritance for reusability and hierarchy
Allows polymorphism for flexible method implementation
Improves modularity, scalability, and maintainability

1. Class
A class is a collection of objects. Classes are blueprints for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can have.

Some points on Python class:
Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Example: Myclass.Myattribute
Creating a Class
Here, class keyword indicates that we are creating a class followed by name of the class (Dog in this case).

Creating a class:
class Dog:
    species = "Canine" #class atribut, shared by all instances in this class
    def __init__(self, name, age):   #initiliazes the name and age attributes when new object is created
        self.name = name  #instance attribute
        self.age = age #inst atr


An Object is an instance of a Class. It represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data.

An object consists of:
State: It is represented by the attributes and reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object and reflects the response of an object to other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute

# Creating an object of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)

print(dog1.name)
print(dog1.species)

Self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows us to access the
attributes and methods of the object.

Example: In this example, we create a Dog class with both class and instance attributes,
then demonstrate how to access them using the self parameter.
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Create an instance of Dog
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)  # Create another instance of Dog

print(dog1.name, dog1.age, dog1.species)  # Access instance and class attributes
print(dog2.name, dog2.age, dog2.species)  # Access instance and class attributes
print(Dog.species)  # Access class attribute directly
###########self.name: Refers to the name attribute of the object (dog1) calling the method.
dog1.bark(): Calls the bark method on dog1

__init__ method is the constructor in Python, automatically called when a new object is created.
 It initializes the attributes of the class.
In this example, we create a Dog class and use __init__ method to set the name and age of each dog when creating an object.
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(dog1.name)

Class Variables
These are the variables that are shared across all instances of a class. It is defined at the class level, outside any methods. All objects of the class share the same value for a class variable unless explicitly overridden in an object.

Instance Variables
Variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. These are defined within the __init__ method or other instance methods. Each object maintains its own copy of instance variables, independent of other objects.

Example: In this example, we create a Dog class to show difference between class variables and instance variables. We also demonstrate how modifying them affects objects differently.
class Dog:
    # Class variable
    species = "Canine"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance variables
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create objects
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)

# Access class and instance variables
print(dog1.species)  # (Class variable)
print(dog1.name)     # (Instance variable)
print(dog2.name)     # (Instance variable)

# Modify instance variables
dog1.name = "Max"
print(dog1.name)     # (Updated instance variable)

# Modify class variable
Dog.species = "Feline"
print(dog1.species)  # (Updated class variable)
print(dog2.species)

#OUTPUT:Canine
Buddy
Charlie
Max
Feline
Feline

Class Variable (species): Shared by all instances of the class. Changing Dog.species affects all objects, as it's a property of the class itself.
Instance Variables (name, age): Defined in the __init__ method. Unique to each instance (e.g., dog1.name and dog2.name are different).
Accessing Variables: Class variables can be accessed via the class name (Dog.species) or an object (dog1.species). Instance variables are accessed via the object (dog1.name).
Updating Variables: Changing Dog.species affects all instances. Changing dog1.name only affects dog1 and does not impact dog2.
